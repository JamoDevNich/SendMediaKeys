# SendMediaKeys
 A basic AutoHotKey-based utility to send media keys in Windows from the command line

## Getting Started
### Requirements
AutoHotKey should be installed on your machine to run the AHK script. Alternatively, a compiled executable is available under "Releases".

### Usage
Three command line parameters are supported:
- `SendMediaKeys.exe --resumepausetrack` sends the *Play Track* media key.
- `SendMediaKeys.exe --previoustrack` sends the *Previous Track* media key.
- `SendMediaKeys.exe --nexttrack` sends the *Next Track* media key.
